# Exercise 5


## Problem 1

Consider a case, where instead of counting events, you are able to additionally measure for each event a discrete property with k possible values and associated probabilities $p_a\; a=1,\dots k$ and $\sum_a p_a = 1$.
Derive the probability of observing $(n_1,\dots,n_k)$ events in each category given a total of n events.

## Problem 2

Show that the joint probability of observing n events with category counts $n_1,\dots, n_k$ , $\sum_i n_i = n$ can be expressed as joint measurement of k individual Poisson processes and derive their individual rates.
