Think of how can you approximate $\\pi$ by throwing \"balls\" into the square and comparing the amount of balls falling inside and outside the circle."

    "2a. Imagine the following game: player 1 and player 2 have each a die of $n_1$ and $n_2$ sides, respectively (i.e player 1 has a die with $n_1$ sides going from $1$ to $n_1$ and player 2 a die with $n_2$ sides going from $1$ to $n_2$). The game consists in each player rolling his die and comparing the results, the larger number wins. Compute the probability $p_1$ for player 1 to win, the probability $p_2$ for player 2 to win and the probability $p_0$ that there is no winner.\n",
